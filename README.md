Usage
Upon opening the index.html file, you will be presented with the main page of the web application. The application will prompt the user to select a type of transaction: view balance, deposit, withdraw, or calculate annual interest.

The deposit and withdraw functions will prompt the user to enter an amount to deposit or withdraw. The application will perform input validation to ensure that the user enters a non-negative numerical input. If the user enters an invalid input, the application will prompt them to enter a valid input.

The view balance function will display the current balance in an alert box.

The calculate annual interest function will prompt the user to enter the number of months to calculate. The application will then project the balance after each month for the specified number of months and display it in an alert box.

The application will continue to prompt the user to perform another transaction until the user decides to stop.
